Why does this application need to be updated every 2 or 3 months. I update (which by the way now takes too long to download update) and nothing seems to have changed. Apparently ima not the only dissatisfied customer. I've always used Chrome and it seems to be regressing in capabilities. I search for something takes a long time in my opinion then once Chrome has found possible choices occasionally it won't take me to site. I'd like to stay with what I know. Seems like it mau be time to move on,3,2

I used to love chrome but in the last few updates it's done nothing but get exceptionally worse with glitches and lagging. Now it's barley functional and completely refusing to update along with android web view. It's been over a month now since the bug has surfaced with absolutely no way to correct it. I've contacted support only to receive generic response's and not so much as even an attempt to troubleshoot the issue out side of asking me to do the exact same thing over and over.,2,2

"I'm still trying to understand why you add new features to the apps, changing what users are used to, and we like. Now tabs are displayed in groups. If you were smarter, you should've known that it should've been added as ""an option"", never as the ""only"" option. It seems to me that you don't really know what users want. Don't make ""changes"" by eliminating previous features, just ""add"" new features as new options for users. It can be a great new option, but keep the old option as well.",2,0

New grid tab display is garbage on a phone. The print size is too small for old people and it is not changeable in the settings. You want to frustrate seniors.

For the most part Google has been pretty good for me so I hope the next update will be a little more thought out and have a lot more positive reviews because this one had practically none,1,2

New update introduces the tab grouping. This is a good idea that could not possibly have been executed in a more frustrating fashion.

Chrome has best experience but now with new updates chrome can't access ftp site genereated by any third party app but previous versions it had support for ftp site and it's worked fine. And this is going to more bad experience ... Now sometimes it says u r offline while having good connection and many other sites can't be reached.... Try to make it better,2,2

Big up to all the developers who thought of this. YOU ARE AMAZING!!! Just to add, I love that I can see what is open without having to enter the page, create my own groups to organise tabs and before I would accidentally close tabs with similar names. Not anymore.
